Friday (and beyond if needed) javascript projects:

Use Single-Page App-principle in all these projects (only the "anchor" on the actual index.html)

1.ToDo app
		Simple ToDo app. ToDos have description and state. States are atleast "pending" and "done" and they are both displayed in their own tables. Optionally
		todos can have a deadline thus adding a state "late". Adding new todos is obviously done with a form. Done todos are not removed but instead are moved
		to a different table to be displayed. They can be removed from there. Load all todos at the same time and use array.prototype.filter in the frontend 
		to create "pending" and "done"-arrays for each table.
		
		You can start by using just an array in the backend for database and then move on to mongodb and mongoose when the front works. Like we did with
		the example.
		
2. Copygram
		Copygram-app. We display images with descriptions. Image location (/public/images/<image_name>.jpg f.ex.) is stored in database along
		with the description and other useful information. Use <img> tags for each image loaded like this. The src is the location given by
		the database. Create an "instagram"-like box for the image and description. Every image gets one. 
		
		Start with already existing images you have downloaded from internet. Uploading new images is a bit more complicated process 
		but can be done with a library called Multer which works with Express. This is an optional part if you wish to challenge yourself.
